It might be a tad bit ambitious for my first post, but I haven’t been able to stop thinking about this for a month. On June 28, 2024, in a controversial ruling, the Supreme Court decided to overturn **Chevron Deference**, a principle that had been established for 40 years in the U.S. Honestly, I did not give this case much attention when it was argued in January, partly because it seemed too grand a ruling for a person with no legal background like me to fully comprehend. It wasn’t until the Supreme Court issued its decision striking down **Chevron Deference** in June, which caused an uproar in the general public, that I found myself researching it, albeit a little. I find it somewhat familiar with a question I once asked myself years ago.

## What is Chevron Deference?

The Chevron doctrine involves a two-step process:

1. Determine whether Congress has spoken directly to the issue at hand. If the law is clear and straightforward on the issue, then both the court and the agency must follow Congress’s intent.

2. If the law is unclear or not specific on the issue, then the court must determine whether the agency’s interpretation is reasonable. If it is, then the court should let the agency decide what it means.

The overruling of **Chevron Deference** grants the court a more active role in interpreting laws, introduces more judicial scrutiny, and aims to create more consistency in how laws are applied. However, in the chaotic realm of U.S. politics, this ruling may not be as simple as it seems. Some describe this ruling *shift power to judges who lack the expertise of agency staff who live and breathe the science, financial principles, and safety concerns that federal agencies specialize in* and as *the biggest judicial power grab since 1803*, potentially leading to a massive increase in legal challenges from corporations.

This may be an oversimplification of the ruling, although I have done my best within my knowledge. One should not just take this information at face value; it is better to read the **court opinion**[^1] or seek an explanation from a legal consultancy.

## Ignorance and knowledge

This ruling for some reasons reminds me of a quote from *Isaac Asimov*:

> The strain of anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge.

One of the core values of democracy is the notion of **"one person, one vote."** This principle ensures that each individual has equal power in the political process and helps prevent those with significant authority from abusing their power. It also serves to remind those in high positions to be mindful of the people’s interests rather than pursuing personal vendettas. The U.S. political system takes this a step further with the introduction of the **Electoral College**, which accounts for state representation as well. It’s not uncommon to hear about this during every election year, as the voting power of an individual in Wyoming is 2 or 3 times greater on a per-vote basis compared to someone in, say, California due to the way electoral votes are allocated.

This makes *Asimov's* words not entirely accurate, but not in a positive way, since my ignorance could potentially be 2 or 3 times as good as your knowledge.

In the past, when a person’s principles could be easily swayed by wealth or fear, what kept the system from falling apart was often science, or at least some semblance of it. With thousands year of accumulating knowledge, science became a focal point for helping people determine the truth and prevent malicious actors from manipulating the democratic system.

## Anti-Intellectualism or Anti-Trust

<!-- Let’s imagine bits and pieces of knowledge as multiple blocks. A person's knowledge is often formed from various sources, including systematic learning from school and personal experiences. This knowledge can be well-structured, but it can also be fragmented or incomplete due to things we failed to comprehend or missed by accident. We often connect these missing blocks of knowledge with our own experiences of the world around us. Science, on the other hand, starts with loose definitions that are almost impossible to prove. However, over time and through the contributions of many people, it gradually becomes more connected and well-structured. 

Proving one part of science wrong can sometimes mean that it might affect other interconnected blocks of knowledge. People often ridicule others for questioning science because they fear that challenging it could undermine the entire foundation. However, this fear can sometimes prevent people from proving themselves right. In a sense, science is like history—something that is continuously built upon. Those who encourage questioning may be using historical events to serve their own agendas rather than seeking the truth. -->
