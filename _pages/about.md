Well, some may ask about my name. Not that I think anyone actually cares; it's just that I myself feel the need to explain it. But it sounds cool, right?

## So what does Hedyosmos mean?


A quick Google search can show you the result.

> Near Pylus, towards the east, is a mountain named after Minthe, who, according to myth, became the concubine of Hades, was trampled under foot by Core, and was transformed into garden-mint, the plant which some call Hedyosmos. Furthermore, near the mountain is a precinct sacred to Hades.

## Then, why the name?


I have always loved soulslike and roguelite games. One of the first roguelite games that I stumbled upon was [Hades](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145360/Hades/) (Great game, by the way). I'm not particularly invested in Greek mythology, to be frank, but if there's one thing I know about Hades, it's that he was one of, if not the only god, who stayed loyal to his wife. 

Love, or more accurately, sex is often perceived as a symbol of power in the ancient world. So, we frequently see gods or individuals with power having multiple concubines and even engaging in incest and interspecies sexuality (e.g., bull, swan). For instance, Zeus was the king of the gods and embodied much of the masculine ideal or aspiration for the culture. They slept with whatever women they chose because, in Ancient Greece, they got what they wanted through force, and this was considered the right of their station as powerful men.

Thus, the King of the Dead comes across to me as a 'weird' god, given how loyally he stayed with his wife despite his status—much like how I view other gods' sexual activities. My curiosity got the better of me, and after spending some time researching Hades' intimate relationships, I found that, aside from his wife Persephone, Minthe was beloved by Hades and became one of his few known mistresses. Minthe boasted of being more beautiful than Persephone, but unlike Leuce, who lived out her life in Hades' embrace, Minthe was barely mentioned in any stories. 

All that we know is that Persephone intervened and transformed Minthe into the garden mint, which some call ***Hedyosmos*** (lit. "sweet-smelling"). According to some accounts, Hades turned his dead lover into the mint herb after a jealous Persephone trampled the nymph underfoot and tore her into pieces for sleeping with him.

So, the name ***Hedyosmos*** represents not only my empathy for the poor nymph but also for many individuals whose beauty and talent may surpass others in various aspects yet never receive the opportunities to thrive, instead being held in disdain by people. It also reflects my wishful thinking for those who face ridicule and hostility while remaining humble and upholding their virtue. Just like mint, which, despite being trampled on throughout its life, still gives off an invigorating scent and sweetness.


## Other Things to Know About Me
#### Music and Two Steps From Hell


I love Two Steps From Hell, especially Thomas Bergersen, their composer. My fascination started back in 2012 when I was trying to find a song that played at every ceremony I attended. If you don't already know, Two Steps From Hell (or TSFH for short) is known for producing trailer music, which is typically orchestral and choral. At that time, music recognition apps like Shazam were not widely known (at least where I lived). None of my friends or family knew about the songs, so my only option was to search on YouTube and listen to every modern orchestral piece I could find. Luckily, after days of searching, I finally discovered it.

{% include gallery id="tsfh_gallery" caption="Some of (in my opinion) the best albums from TSFH. Many may find the track *Victory* from the **Battlecry** album, released in 2015, familiar." %}

*Heart of Courage* was the song I was looking for. Composed by Thomas J. Bergersen in 2008 and released in 2010 on the group's first commercial album, **Invincible**.

> “Heart of Courage” really put the group on the map, showing up in multiple mainstream trailers. The song instantly whisks us away to a ship at sea with the crew scrambling before a fight. Or maybe it’s a space opera, with starfighters dodging enemy fire. It would also work for an epic last stand or a bayonet charge.  
> No matter which visual you prefer, this piece of adventure music somehow captures the excitement and danger that we’d expect to find in another place or time. In just two minutes, this song creates an experience that might take 30 minutes to achieve in a visual medium.

Quickly, I found myself exploring all of TSFH's and later Thomas Bergersen's music. Personally, I consider some tracks from the **Illusions** and **Sun** albums, along with the seven chapters of **Humanity** by Thomas, to be among the best pieces of music of our lifetime. Discovering their works has been one of the luckiest things of the past decade in my life.


#### Gaming and soulslike


Well, there’s not much more to say on this topic. As mentioned earlier, I’m a fan of soulslike games and have completed many notable titles in this genre, such as the *Nioh* series, *Sifu*, and *Salt and Sanctuary*, as well as most of **FromSoftware**'s games. One exception is *Dark Souls II*—I’ve never played it and probably won’t, as my first hour with the game wasn’t very enjoyable, and I don’t have the time to commit to it.

{% include gallery id="er" caption="Elden Ring is perhaps the greatest masterpiece that FromSoftware has ever crafted." %}

I also dabble in roguelite games, though I don’t invest as much time in them. *Hades*, *Dead Cells*, and *Slay the Spire* are some of the best I’ve played in this genre.

One of the many reasons I keep coming back to **FromSoftware**'s games is their vibrant modding community, which I feel is worth mentioning. As someone with some knowledge of this topic and modest experience in modding, I find the community's passion for the gameplay and lore of these games truly impressive. I can't help but admire their dedication.

*Dark Souls: Nightfall*, *Dark Souls 3: Archthrones*, and *Sekiro: Resurrection* are some of the best overhaul mods I can recommend. Although *Armored Core VI* and *Elden Ring* are still relatively new, both have been massively successful, so I have no doubt that great mods will emerge for them soon.


#### Other Interests


I'm not particularly a sports enthusiast, so outdoor activities are usually not for me. However, I do regularly watch football (U.S. soccer), especially following Messi, Pep Guardiola's team, and the tiki-taka style of play.

Writing isn’t my strong suit either. You might wonder who is writing this—well, it’s still me. Back in mid-2024, amidst the ongoing global economic impact of the 2019 COVID-19 pandemic, I found myself struggling to land a new job. Alongside my inner turmoil, as reading no longer kept me sane, I began writing here and there to channel my ideas and maintain some sense of control.

You might notice improvements in my writing over time, or you might not see much change. But this is part of how I’m developing my writing habit. Hopefully, in the near future, I will no longer need to rely on some grammar checker to correct my silly mistakes.

Low-level coding is something I may dabble in occasionally, and I also sometimes find myself enjoying the chaos of the U.S. political sphere. However, forgive me for my lack of knowledge on these issues, as I mostly look at these subjects on a very surface level without diving too deep.

And finally, take a minute or two enjoying this song. Have a great day.
