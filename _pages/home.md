excerpt: >
  <small> In the grand scheme of things, life unfolds in the blink of an eye.  
  
  A time will come when we're granted a breath of clarity, if only for a second.  
  
  A fleeting chance to open our eyes, our ears, our hearts, to see and feel.  
  
  <br>
  
  Truthfully, I know not for this feeling, for I've never experienced such a moment.  
  
  Perhaps it dawned with my first breath, as I marveled at the world anew.  
  
  Perhaps it awaits at lifeâ€™s edge, a whisper of solace, assuring me I am not alone.  
  
  Or perhaps I simply hope that this transient moment is still yet to come.</small>
